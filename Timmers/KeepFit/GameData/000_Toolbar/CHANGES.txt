1.5.2, 2014-02-08

  available. Instead, the toolbar will always show the configuration button as
  long as no other buttons are configured to be visible.
- Fixed a bug where the toolbar would lose the configured visibility of some
  buttons.
- Fixed a bug where a newly-created folder would not respect the "show border"
  setting of the main toolbar.
- Plugin authors: Added an official Toolbar Plugin wrapper that can be used to
  provide Toolbar Plugin support without creating a hard dependency. Check the
  development forum thread at http://bit.ly/1b1ZXda for details.

  no buttons are visible at first. Toolbar location will be preserved.
